###Rotate your crops; it's good for the soil


Just like your garden, creative people should rotate their projects, or they burn out

Projects shouldn't all be the same
Vegetable plants have different needs: beans fix nitrogen into the soil, and then plant your broccoli. Rotation also stops disease as vegetables planted in the same place year on year can build up bad bits in their soil.  Unless you can afford a lot of manure, the soil should also have a rest, in order to make it ready for producing beautiful crops the next time.

Just like your garden, as a creative person, you need different types of projects for gaining different types of skills and should make an effort to work on them at different times of the year. You will burn out if you take on one ultra challenging project followed by another and another.  A happy mix of challenging /exciting/money making/ straight forward/ and then a break is the best way to keep you fresh.

Prevent disease and keep your skills healthy
What happens when a designer works day after day, month after month on the same thing?   They lose the ability to be creative, stop being able to draw as well, which in turn leads to stagnating talent.  They stop coming up with creative ideas, stop challenging their skills and don't improve.  

So, just as if you plant the same crop in your garden season after season your soil sours and you're riddled with disease, designers sour too, if they don’t make sure they take time to work on their own thing.  This could include...

*Working on personal projects

	
*Taking a day off

	
*Reading about influential new ideas

	
*Exploring the rest of the world for inspiration

	
*Meeting like-minded, talented people

	
*Writing their own blog entries (hello!) to solidify opinions

	
*Try out new technologies

Happy gardening!

I love gardening and web designing, and every day I see the lessons I learn while gardening relate to the work I do in web design.  This is the second in a series of short posts on similarities between gardening and web design business.  Read the first post, 
[Don’t sow more than your space allows](http://thisiscapra.com/2011/05/web-design-garden-1/).  If you have any good gardening analogies, please let me know for future entries!
