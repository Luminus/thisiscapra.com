Last week, 
[police.uk](http://police.uk) launched, at a reported cost of £300,000.  Sometimes you see a website that you think, "Wow, that website probably cost them a pretty penny."  This wasn't one of them. As a web design firm that works closely with a web development agency, we spoke about how much it would cost for us to build something like that together.

###What is it all about?

The website itself is very simple: you enter in your postcode, and it let's you know what crimes have occurred in your neighbourhood in the past month.  You can zoom in and find out what sort of crime was committed (whether it be anti-social behaviour, burglary etc).  It also lets you know who the police officers are for your area, any information from your police force and what meetings are upcoming.

###How much should this cost?

First off, they made no attempt at design.  From a design perspective, a simple 'police' themed logo would have helped enormously to make the site seem more trustworthy-- a very important feature for sites about crime and policing.  The layout of the actual application is simple, but it's not anything groundbreaking or new.


![](http://thisiscapra.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/policeuk-300x196.jpg)We could make a much nicer design for much less than £3000, and that would include coding up the design too.  But, we're dealing with a big bureaucracy, so let's say, with changes, it would cost £5000 for design and html/css.

The development though, is where your big costs come in.  Our partner agency, KickCode reckons they could build the whole thing, including the api for £15,000.  You can read more about their breakdown here.  So, together we could have built that, and nicer for £20,000.  Let's allow £10,000 for hosting, and you all know that's being generous.  So that's £30,000.  That's 10% of the cost.

###So, why did it cost £300,000?

On twitter, someone mentioned that they were paying for the fact that it was dealing with lots of data that could also deal with lots of traffic.  Unfortunately, when we first went to visit the site, it was down.  It was down all day.  That's not worth that kind of money, at least not what we would expect for that price tag.  We were just using it now, and the whole thing freaked out: coming back to it it starting refreshing and not working.

The fact that it doesn't look very professional or modern, too, would suggest that someone got ripped off.  Spending a few grand on a decent designer would have increased trust for the police force.

A good development agency would have made sure that the site could have handled the traffic that they must have anticipated they'd get.  KickCode would use a scalable hosting solution, such as Heruko would allow it to accommodate lots of traffic when it happens, but then scale down when you don't.

When an agency charges that sort of money, and a website such as this is the result, it makes our whole industry look bad.  Of course, with governments reportedly 
[spending over £500 on updating a favicon](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/feb/04/government-it-contracts-information-commissioner-office), are we really surprised that this kind of spending is done?
