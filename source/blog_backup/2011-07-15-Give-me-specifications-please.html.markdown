Recently, I have been doing some print work on a web project.  It's fun: the clients are really nice and I'm happy with what we're doing.  On the first print component I worked on, I asked which printer they were using so that I could format the files properly.  The client hadn't yet chosen their printing company and said to just prepare the file and they'd get the company specifications later.
Even though I told them that there was no guarantee that I would get things right, they insisted that I get it done.  So, I designed the document, and showed them what it would look like.  When they were happy, I prepped the document with a 5mm bleed as is standard in printing to edges.  I explained to the client why, and they said, "No, remove the bleed".  After another explanation, and no dice, I said, "Please ask your printing company about their policy on bleed."

Their sales rep said, "No bleed necessary".

The customer is right, right?

**Finally I gave in, and produced the final print document without a bleed.  The next day, I received a forwarded email from their printing staff saying that the file was the wrong size.**
 FINALLY I was dealing with someone who understood, and they sent me a specifications document.  In it: Bleed required (at 3mm). (Don't even get me started on the fact that a printing company employs sales reps that won't give people spec documents and don't understand what a bleed is.  Grrr.)

What I learned from all this

***If you can, cut the client out of the printing conversation**
:  if you can deal directly with the printing company, knowledge that you have (and your client is paying for) doesn't need to be transfered through multiple people.

	
***Show clients what the final version where they will see what it will look like**
, not the press-ready version.

	
***Get the specification document as soon as possible:**
often by the time the design is signed off, it's urgently needed, so you don't want to spend over a week changing things and learning how to upload them to your printer.

	
***Have your own printing company that you know and trust.**
 That way, you don't waste time figuring out how they do things!

How about you?
Have you got any tips for me to make printing jobs easier?
