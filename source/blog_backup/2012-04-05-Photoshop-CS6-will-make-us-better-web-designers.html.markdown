For those who haven't done so, go try out Photoshop CS6.  You'll try it for its speed, and you'll stay for its new and improved features.  The one I'm most excited about is the paragraph and character styles.

When you're designing for web, being diligent in maintaining accurate spacing before and after titles, between blocks of content, has always been an absolute drag.  For us types that like to do things quickly, it was just annoying.  If I decided that I liked a bit more space above what I was going to call an h3, I'd have to try and remember where I had it on every single comp and change it.
