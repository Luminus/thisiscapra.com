Starting today, I will be putting my own company on hold, and going back to working full time for a company.  While it has been a great ride, and I have learned so much about managing a business, it is time for me to grow as a designer, and that means Capra will get some rest.

![](http://thisiscapra.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/goat-sleeping-300x225.jpg)I am honoured to be working for 
[Natron Baxter](http://natronbaxter.com/), an applied gaming company I have been freelancing with for a while.  While I thought no one could tempt me away from my business, this company is like no other.   The projects are interesting, fun and ethically sound-- I'm working on making games!  The people are the most talented I've ever worked with (and I am finally getting the mentoring I have always wanted), and I am learning to flex creative muscles I haven't used in years.  It will be, in some ways, my hardest challenge yet.  They want me to do UX, UI, front end and everything in between.  I want to do for them better work than I've ever done.

This goat won't die, it's just resting for now.  See you soon!
