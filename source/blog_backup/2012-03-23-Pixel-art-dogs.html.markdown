[![Kenny and Indy](http://thisiscapra.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pixel-dogs-new-300x194.png)](http://thisiscapra.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pixel-dogs-new.png)Every once in a while you have to take a break from coding, so this morning we decided to make pixel art of our lovely dogs in the Capra office. We set ourselves half an hour to make pixel versions of Kenny the spaniel and Indy the whippet and this is the result!
