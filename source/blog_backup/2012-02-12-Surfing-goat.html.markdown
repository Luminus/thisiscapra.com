There's no denying that I'm obsessed with goats.  My blog website was called 
[safetygoat](http://safetygoat.co.uk) for gods sake and featured a lifejacket-wearing goat as its logo.

So when I saw this surfing goat, of course I thought it was the coolest.  Goatee is my hero. I may be obsessed with my dog, but this is making me want to get a goat friend for Kenny even more!

[Goatee is on facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Goatee-The-Surfing-Goat).

(The owner, Dayna McGregor, is also selling t-shirts to sponsor buying goats for needy families.  You get a t-shirt if you sponsor.  If you would like to join in,
