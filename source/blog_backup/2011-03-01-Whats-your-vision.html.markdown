When setting up your business, you need to make sure you have your company’s vision in mind. The vision explains in under 10 words what your company means to you and has 2 very important parts: core ideology and envisioned future.  What/who you are now and forever, and where you want to go.

In the webdesign market, competition is fierce and you need to be able to tell your clients what you are about and where you want to go. It’s not as easy as simply showing your past work, but explaining how their work fits in with your own vision of your company’s future.

You need to do it right.###What is a vision?

Well, that depends on how you define it. In business terms, Collins & Porras state it “provides guidance about what core to preserve and what future to stimulate progress toward” (p.66). They explain that a “a vision consists of two major components: 
core ideology and 
envisioned 
future” (p, 66). 
**The core “defines what we stand for and why we exist” whereas the envisoned future is “what we aspire to become, to achieve, to create” (p.66).**


The core values and envisioned future help for success. They are easily confused, so it's important to know what they are and get yours set so you know what your business is about and where you want to go.

Core ideology
It is something that will 
**NEVER**
 change for the company. It is authentic and part of the company. It “is the reason why the organization exists” (p.74) and “can never be completed” (p.74). It keeps the company reaching for it in the distance. Collins & Porras suggest to ask yourself: What core values do you truly and passionately hold? Use the core ideology to “guide and inspire”.

Some big company's Core Ideologies:

3M: “To solve unsolved problems innovatively”

Wal-Mart: “To give ordinary folk the chance to buy the same things as rich people”

Walt Disney: “To make people happy”

The core values should never change.

Envisioned Future
This is where all your company dreams and aspirations come into play, or as Collins & Parras put it: BHAG -  Big, Harry, Audacious, Goals. It’s where you see your company in the future. You need audacious goals and "vivid descriptions of what it will be like to achieve the goal” (p.74). This gives people the opportunity to see the image clearly in their heads. “Passion, emotion, and conviction are essential parts of the vivid description” (p.74).

It is not easy to create the core ideology or the envisioned future, but if you want to have a concrete goal to work towards, we suggest that you get started now.
