title: Maximizing your minimum

Many clients want me to be available whenever they need some little changes, or even new phases of their projects.  I can understand this, so I also offer the opportunity to book a permanent weekly slot with me. Most of the time, this means that they'll want me for an average amount of time per week.

This works out great for both parties:  I know that I will leave space open for them, and they know that they can get work done on an ongoing basis.
In order to make this reasonable for me, I set a minimum and a maximum for the week.###Minimum

The key with a contract like this is that you get paid for ongoing work, which means you get a minimum amount every month. If they don't use those hours, and they haven't given me a week's notice that they do not require my time, they still need to pay for that time that I've left open for them.  For some clients, this may mean I am chasing them up every week, asking if there's anything they need doing.  Neither me nor my client want to be paying for nothing, so if, after a few weeks of no work, I need to sit down with my client and rethink our plans.

###Maximum

Just like the minimum, it is important to cap the number of hours you can work for a specific client.  Even if they have extra work, but you can't fit it in, you're protected from too much overwork.  Simply stating that you're out of hours for this week, and that you'll have to pick it up the following week.  Setting expectations is important, but in terms of how much they will be billed for, and how much work they can expect to get from you.

###Pros

With set amounts of work with clients, you're guaranteed a certain amount of cashflow every month.  Because you're charging hourly too, it means that you aren't stuck with a dry spell money-wise when launch dates get pushed back. It also means that you're certain that your client is in for the long haul.  Most of the time, websites get launched with untested features, or things that are rushed.  When you have an ongoing relationship, you can work towards making sure you maintain quality control.  You're also lucky enough to be able to limit your hours, meaning if you plan your clients properly, you can avoid those 18 hour work days :)

###Cons

These situations are mostly good, until things start going bad.  If clients aren't organized, it can feel like a constant game of email chasing.  I've also had situations where I've been brought in for one project that I'm really excited about, only to find out that another project I didn't sign up for ends up being all I work on for them.  Getting out of these contracts when you no longer enjoy a project can be difficult (at least with fixed length projects, there's an end!).
