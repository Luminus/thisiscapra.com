I have finally updated my website!  A lot has happened since I last did it (2 years!), and I have been trying to wrestle between my need for perfection and my need to get it up and out.  I hope that it maintains a balance between its existing aesthetic and my changing skillset, and will be a base for me to continue to improve it.

###The logo

While I hate the marketing speak, it truly is a brand refresh (and a website MVP).  The logo maintains its original character, just refined and, I think, more elegant and versatile. The curvatures in the goat horns remains the same, but the new design has an angular symmetry to it.

###The font

The font remains Minister but I have opted for the lighter version, which allows me to use a wider range of sizes and treatments without feeling so heavy.  The font colour too, goes from a straight black to one with a tint of dark navy in it.  Again, this is to give my text a slightly less harsh tone, without sacrificing its crispiness.

###Other stuff

The portfolio remains quite consistent with previous versions, but the screenshots highlight the work I've done for mobile and iOS apps, as I have been working more on those than websites in the past year.  I have also highlighted more testimonials from those I have worked with.  I feel blessed that people seem to like me so much!  The about page will (hopefully soon) be a playground for animation, some cool graphing and other areas I have been experimenting with.

The website is a work in progress, but since I have completed the basics, I felt it was time to put it up.  I plan on getting some more fun (a game, perchance?), more animations, refined copy and layout (tips welcome) and so much more.  Thus, this is my MVP (Minimum Viable Product): it has everything people need to see, and with time, will contain more and more of the features that make websites feel oh so good.

###What do you think?

Do you like it?  Did you find a typo?  Would love to hear your thoughts :)
