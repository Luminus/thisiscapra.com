    testimonial: "I've worked with Kat and Ollie on numberous projects over the years for many different companies and they are always the first people I turn to when I need a high quality product to be delivered. 850 Sports Digest was the most intense project we have worked on together yet with me setting tight budgets and pushing on delivery times and asking the world of the quality of the look and feel and features. But as always, they delivered above expectation and even advised me when they thought my thinking was on the wrong track. With their long, flawless track record in design, UI /UX and even front-end development, this kind of two way relationship is very valuable and my app is a much better product because of it."

    link: 'http://mtpcon.com/'
    intro: "MindtheProduct is a very popular meetup group for product managers, and in 2012 they launched their very first conference. Kat was approached to come up with a simple, fun and elegant design. The first year's website was a simple one-page design, based on their brand's colours and circle logo, where the circles moved as you scrolled. See <a href='http://mtpcon.com/london/2012'>Mind the Product 2012</a> for the live site."
    sub_text: "Because we were both so pleased with the first year's efforts, we knew we had to come up with something fun and different for the second year's conference. 2013 website's homepage features a video background from last year's conference. See <a href='http://mtpcon.com/london/2013'>Mind the Product 2013</a> for the live site. The canvas was perfect: with very little content, we could let the design breath and really speak to product managers. After all, this was meant to inspire product managers to make great, innovative products!  Then in 2014, the founders decided to go for simple and practical.  We created a website that could be modified through Wordpress, and could be reused for future years too. See <a href='http://mtpcon.com/london/2014'>Mind the Product 2014</a> for the  2014 site. The build needed to be flexible enough to adapt to multiple locations (San Francisco and London this year!), pre-conference (no speakers, just teasers), full conference (speakers, tickets for sale) and post conference (wrap up, thank you and archiving).  We continue to work with Martin and the rest of the MindTheProduct team to keep their website fresh!"
