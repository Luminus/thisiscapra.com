    testimonial: "I've worked with Kat and Ollie on numberous projects over the years for many different companies and they are always the first people I turn to when I need a high quality product to be delivered. 850 Sports Digest was the most intense project we have worked on together yet with me setting tight budgets and pushing on delivery times and asking the world of the quality of the look and feel and features. But as always, they delivered above expectation and even advised me when they thought my thinking was on the wrong track. With their long, flawless track record in design, UI /UX and even front-end development, this kind of two way relationship is very valuable and my app is a much better product because of it."

    intro: "After demoing a well-received prototype, Totomerch wished to expand their app from a restrictive flash application to a robust app that reflected all of their user feedback. Their aim was to make it easy for bands to sell one-off merchandise so they wouldn't have to keep lots of stock. Toto needed a design that was clean but also up to date and modern enough for this hip crowd. The site also needed to be easy to use. I used neutral backgrounds with subtle textures and bold calls-to-action to lead the users through the website."
